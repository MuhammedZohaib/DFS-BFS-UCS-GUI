# Pathfinding Visualization

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) application for visualizing pathfinding algorithms on a 2D grid. The program allows you to generate random obstacle grids, set start and goal positions, and run different pathfinding algorithms to find paths between them.

## Features

- **Graphical Visualization**: View a 2D grid representation of the pathfinding environment.
- **Random Grid Generation**: Generate random obstacle grids with configurable obstacle density.
- **Start and Goal Setting**: Click on the grid to set start and goal positions for pathfinding.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Execute Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithms to find paths.
- **Execution Time Display**: See the execution time of each algorithm.

## Usage

1. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MuhammedZohaib/DFS-BFS-UCS-GUI.git
     ```
   - Install required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install tkinter
     ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
